# C-Sharp
Projects/assignments developed for Programming I and II courses at Centennial College (2022-2023)

Programming I (2022) and Programming II (2023) courses offered an introduction to developing in C#. Each project folder has a PDF copy of the assignment description and all the files submitted.
The culminating project was in Programming II assignment 4 where I developed a BMI Calculator using C# as a Windows Forms Application from scratch.
